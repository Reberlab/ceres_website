      <h4> This webpage is designed to be self-guided, offering tasks that you can complete as needed to address gaps
        in your training. Below, you will find tasks that will help you refine skills such as plotting MGRS coordinates,
        calculating azimuths, identifying terrain features, and much more. All tasks will redirect you to Empirical.

      <h3 class="text-center"> MGRS Grid Practice Task</h3>
      <p> The purpose of this task is to train on finding coordinates on a map using the Military Grid Reference System
        (MGRS). </p>
      <p>Users have to mark on the map where they believe the correct location of the given coordinates. They have access
        to a protractor, which can help them find the answer. <br></p>

      <h3 class="text-center"> Azimuth Training Task</h3>
      <p> The purpose of this task is to train how to find the azimuth between two points.</p>
      <p> Users must find two point and then input the degree (increments of 5) that they believe the two point are
        from one another. Users have access to a protractor to help them find the coordinate points and the degrees, as
        well as a tool to draw a straight line between the points.<br></p>

      <p> The purpose of this task is to train on identifying different type of terrain features on a topographic map. </p>
      <p>Users will decide what is the correct feature at the given MGRS coordinates. They can use map features like
        protractor and marking tool to help answer questions.<br></p>

      <p> The purpose of this task is to train on finding the best attack points to the given objective point on a
        topographic map. </p>
      <p>Users have to decide, out of the given option, would be the best attack point to reach the objective point.
        They can use map features like protractor and marking tool to help answer questions.<br></p>

      <h3 class="text-center"> Terrain Association Task</h3>
      <p> The purpose of this task is to train users how to determine where they are located on a map using the terrain
      and landmarks around them.</p>
      <p> Users are presented a video and must use the information that they see in that video to try to determine where
      they are located on a map. Points are credited based on how close they mark their location to the correct answer and
      on the direction they mark that they are facing.</p>
