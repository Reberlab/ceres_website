      <h3 class="text-center"> Coordinate Training Task</h3>
      <p> The purpose of this task is to train on finding coordinates on a map using the Military Grid Reference System
        (MGRS). </p>
      <p>Users have to mark on the map where they believe the correct location of the given coordinates. They have access
        to a protractor, which can help them find the answer. Points are credited based on accuracy.<br></p>

      <h3 class="text-center"> Azimuth Training Task</h3>
      <p> The purpose of this task is to train how to find the azimuth between two points.</p>
      <p> Users must find two point and then input the degree (increments of 5) that they believe the two point are
        from one another. Users have access to a protractor to help them find the coordinate points and the degrees, as
        well as a tool to draw a straight line between the points. Points are credited based on accuracy of marking the
        two given coordinates and inputting the correct azimuth.<br></p>

      <h3 class="text-center"> Terrain Association Task</h3>
      <p> The purpose of this task is to train users how to determine where they are located on a map using the terrain
      and landmarks around them.</p>
      <p> Users are presented a video and must use the information that they see in that video to try to determine where
      they are located on a map. Points are credited based on how close they mark their location to the correct answer and
      on the direction they mark that they are facing.</p>
