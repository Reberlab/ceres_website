                topographic map</h4>
            <h4> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Identify the azimuth heading between two given points</h4>
            <h4> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Identify attack points for navigation</h4>
            <h4> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Test your terrain feature reading skills</h4>
            <h4> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> You can also practice terrain association with simulated
                maps and landscapes</h4>
